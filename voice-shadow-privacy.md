# Privacy Policy for Voice Shadow

**Last Updated:** December 3, 2025

## 1. Introduction
**Voice Shadow** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

**Core Principle:** Voice Shadow is an **offline-first application**. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external servers.

## 2. Permissions We Request

### Microphone Access
*   **Why we need it:** To analyze audio frequencies in real-time for the core visualizer and voice training features.
*   **Data Handling:** All audio processing happens **locally on your device**. No audio recordings are uploaded to the cloud or shared with third parties. The audio data is processed in RAM and discarded immediately after visualization.

### Photo Library Access (Optional)
*   **Why we need it:** To save the "Agent Profile" images or screenshots you explicitly choose to generate and share.
*   **Data Handling:** We only write images to your device's storage. We do not read your other photos.

## 3. Data Collection and Usage
Since the App functions offline:
*   We **do not** collect personal identification information (PII).
*   We **do not** use third-party analytics services that track user behavior.
*   We **do not** serve personalized advertisements.

## 4. Local Data Storage
Any progress data (such as your Training Level, Streak, and Radar Chart stats) is stored securely **on your device** using local database technologies. You have full control over this data and can clear it at any time via the "Wipe Mission Data" option in Settings.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
